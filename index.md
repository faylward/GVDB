## Welcome to the Giant Virus Database!

Here you will find a collection of data products generated from a broad range of *Nucleocytoviricota* genomes to facilitate the genomic and phylogenetic analysis of viruses in this phylum.
<br/>

We recently wrote a preprint describing these data products in detail, together with a taxonomy and phylogenomic framework for the *Nucleocytoviricota*. You can read it [**here**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.442809v1?rss=1)

## Resources

### Hierarchical taxonomy of reference genomes
We produced a hierarchical taxonomy based on a benchmarked phylogeny of 1,382 *Nucleocytoviricota* genomes. You can view the tree on iTOL [**here**](https://itol.embl.de/tree/1281731864487941620067021) 
<br/>
<br/>
OR you can access the spreadsheet of annotated genomes [**here**](https://github.com/faylward/GVDB/raw/gh-pages/GVDB_Genome_Descriptions.xlsx)

### HMMs
Giant Virus Orthologous Groups (GVOGs) are a set of 8,863 protein families found in *Nucleocytoviricota*. HMMs and their descriptions are provided  <br/> [**Download here**](https://zenodo.org/record/4728209/files/GVOGs.tar.gz?download=1)
