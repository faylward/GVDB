## Welcome to the Giant Virus Database!

Here you will find a collection of data products generated from a broad range of *Nucleocytovirocita* genomes to facilitate the genomic and phylogenetic analysis of viruses in this phylum.

### Hierarchical taxonomy of reference genomes
We produced a hierarchical taxonomy based on a benchmarked phylogeny of 1,382 Nucleocytoviricota genomes. You can view the tree on iTOL [**here**](https://itol.embl.de/tree/1281731864487941620067021) 
<br/>
OR you can access the spreadsheet of annotated genomes [**here**](https://github.com/faylward/GVDB/blob/gh-pages/GVDB_Genome_Descriptions.xlsx)
